Brute Force Q&A!

A web server has detected multiple failed login attempts from a single IP address over a short time frame. Given the provided logs...

What is the attacker's user agent?		
	A review of authentication logs shows repeated login attempts originating from a single IP address (203.0.113.99) and is submitting multiple failed test (as indicated by the log attempts) we can conclude the agent is:
	"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/112.0.5615.50 Safari/537.36"

What is the IP address of the attacker who performed the Brute Forcing attack?
	As identified in previous question, 203.0.113.99
	
What date did the Brute Forcing successfully complete to login form? Format: dd/MMM/yyyy HH:mm:ss?
	The first successful login attempt (as indicated by status code 301) is 26/Apr/2023 21:44:03.
	
The best strategies for addressing such an attack would be to implement MFA, CAPTCHA, a WAF, and a limit to the rate of login attempts
