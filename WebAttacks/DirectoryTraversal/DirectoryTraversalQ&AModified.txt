Directory Traversal Q&A!

When an attacker manipulates input parameters to access unauthorized files and directories on a web server, it is called Directory Traversal. By injecting special character sequences like ../, %2e%2e%2f, %5c, they are able to navigate files on the server hosting the website.


What date did the exploitation phase of Directory Traversal start? Format: dd/MMM/yyyy HH:mm:ss
We can see that at 23/Apr/2023 00:16:57 using %2e%2e%2f and %2e%2e%5c, and given the 200 code, it was most likely a successful traversal.

What is the IP address of the attacker who performed the Directory Traversal attack?
198.51.100.27


What was the parameter that attacked?
uid


To prevent directory traversal attacks in the future, I would recommend sanitizing input, limit the server's access to the required files and directories, and create a whitelist of characters allowed for input to prevent such traversals.
