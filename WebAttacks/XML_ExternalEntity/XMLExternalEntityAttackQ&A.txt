XML External Entity Q&A!

An XML External Entity attack occurs when an attacker exploits improperly configured XML parsers to access local files or execute malicious code. 

What parameter affected XXE?
By analyzing the request payload, we determine that the parameter affected by XXE injection was data.


What file did that attacker try to read using XXE?

 The logs indicate an attempt to retrieve a sensitive system file: '/etc/shadow' which is a linux file containing hashes of passwords.

What was the attacker's IP address?

198.51.100.99


The strategies I would suggest implementing is to disable external entities with XML (with something like libxml_disable_entity_loader(true);), sanitize input, utilize secure parsers, and implement a whitelist of entities that can make changes with XML.
